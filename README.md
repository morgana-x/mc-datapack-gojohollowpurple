# mc-datapack-gojohollowpurple
You can become him in just 1 datapack!

Only enabled for specific people (ie: morgana because you should definitely give them god powers)

Whoever you want to set to gojo just do scoreboard players set person gojo 1

(Need to respawn to receive effects and items)

Obviously can set to 0 as well to remove that, (Please note that the username __morgana will always be set to gojo each time the pack is loaded, edit the code if you don't want that!)



Currently Adds:
+ Hollow Purple
+ Concentrated Hollow Purple
+ Red
+ Big Red
+ Blue

Whoever is assigned as gojo will also get multiple effects each respawn

Gojo is still defeatable! (Probably, hope noone cuts him in half :( )
