# mc-datapack-gojohollowpurple
You can become him in just 1 datapack!

Only enabled for specific people (ie: morgana because you should definitely give them god powers)

Currently Adds:
+ Hollow Purple
+ Concentrated Hollow Purple
+ Red
+ Big Red
+ Blue

Whoever is assigned as gojo will also get multiple effects each respawn

Gojo is still defeatable! (Probably, hope noone cuts him in half :( )
